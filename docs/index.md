# Chronometric Age Extension

NOTE: This document forms part of a proposal by the [Chronometric Age Extension Task Group](https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/chrono/) to extend Darwin Core with vocabulary for chronometric ages. It is not yet ratified and may change as a result of recommendations received during the course of Open Public Commentary.

The Chronometric Age extension is a standard vocabulary maintained by the [Darwin Core Maintenance Interest Group](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/dwc/#maintenance%20group). It includes a glossary of terms (in other contexts these might be called properties, elements, fields, columns, attributes, or concepts) intended to **facilitate the sharing of information about chronometric ages and the techniques used to determine them.** by providing identifiers, labels, and definitions.
